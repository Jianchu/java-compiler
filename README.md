Member: Zhiyuan Lin, Ho-Yi Fung, Jianchu Li

## Overview
This is an implementation of a compiler for a subset of Java 1.3 called joos. 

The joos langauge is specified here: http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs444/joos.html. This implementation targets x86 assembly. Test cases for the compiler are included in the assignment_testcases directory.

## Note:
This repository is copied from GitLab where the project is putted when we built it. The reports for each assignment are removed from the repository.
